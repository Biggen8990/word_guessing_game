Word Guessing Game (Python Console)

A simple replayable word guessing game built in Python. Users guess a randomly selected secret word from a list, with hints, guess limits, and automated checks for repeated or blank inputs. Easily extendable for new features like scoring, word lists, or mobile apps.

## Features
- Random word selection from a preset list
- Guess limit with automatic loss message
- Input validation (no blanks; prevents repeated guesses)
- Alphabetical “before/after” hints after wrong guesses
 Option to replay after each round
- Clean, testable codebase with functions suitable for unit testing

## How to Play
1. Run the script:  
    `python3 word_game.py`
2. Guess the secret word with each prompt.
3. Try to guess within the allowed number of tries for a win!
4. Play again as long as you’d like.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Future Plans
- Add high score tracking and leaderboard
- Build a mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Optional multiplayer and additional word packs
